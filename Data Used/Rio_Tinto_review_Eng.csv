There are brilliant people that work at all levels of the company, so it is amazing that this pattern of mismanagement continues. It seems to be the new culture of the company.

IT model is offshoring at all cost. In previous life, once did an SAP support job supporting 250 users, Rio's requirement was for around 10k users. This corporation shed a lot of people in the past 10 years so lots of friends got some intermediate manager roles. Result you will likely have to answer to a large number of individuals and spend a lot of time in meetings and yet you must meet deadlines. Rio's IT operation runs around the clock since on all continents. This means you will likely have meeting at odd hours to catch up with Australian and Indian folks. Their business solution was built by Indian low cost junior resources and by so called contractors that for the most part could not get a contractor's job in the current market conditions. User acceptance of the solution can be labelled as spotty. Conclusion, this solution is extremely complex and worthy of a complete rewrite. You can easily expect 6 months before being comfortable with such a custom solution and it does get very frustrating since so much has been Zed. If you happen to be very proficient, you will make lots of friends fast and Office Communicator will drive the number of interruptions through the roof.All in all mining is in a terrible situation at the moment and this is not a place for the faint of heart. The above reflection might have been influenced by local realities and may not be generalized throughout for their various groups. Like others have mentioned, some groups may be better than others.

386,Great opportunities and large exposure,Principal,Perth,"June 8, 2015","I have worked for Rio Tinto almost eight years and delivered many projects successfully. Some projects were very challenging due to many operational staff with personal empires. As a project manager you get to know the traits of many stakeholders across the business and find the best way to get things done. I enjoyed my time with Rio and I have learned so much about the business and the job really developed me too. I have gained enormous experience and were fortunate to meet very senior stakeholders during the time I delivered key projects. In my role as Principle, I was responsible for the governance of the mine operations and expansion projects IT and technology requirements. This was a serious challenge since everyone was trying to do their own thing with little understanding why we try to control things. The governing part was mostly around standardization and cost. My role was to prevent people from spending. It teaches me to learn to work with diverse people and diverse operational areas. I have gained enormous people skills during my time at Rio which was needed to work with a large portfolio and many leaders with a budget that they can spend to get done what they want done. In many areas business rules were completely ignored which is probably a standard thing in a large organization.My overall rating is only a 3 Star purely because of my knowledge I've gained with my MBA. There are little attention paid to the quality of managers and how they apply succession and appropriate performance evaluations. There is little visibility to MoR and only those well known to executives,¬ ¬ more... really get the opportunity to develop in career development. Most managers or leaders prevent HiPos from developing. Can't count everyone under this statement though, there are really good and quality people working at this large organization and managers with really good qualities. In my MBA I have learned a lot about how to manage and treat people to get the best out of them. I have also learned how HR should be aligned with the business goals. In Rio HR is outsourced, leaving most development to the direct leaders discretion. If your leader nominates you and his leader agrees, then maybe you get a chance. If I get an opportunity at Rio again, then I will do what I did before, deliver to the best I can, but will not keep my hopes high to be noticed for a key role. On the end of the day it comes down to who you know. As Project Managers we are also guilty of that but in Project Management you have to surround yourself with HiPos because you have deadlines to meet. Rio will always remain a great company to work for and their remuneration packages are very well structured.¬ ¬ less",Networking opportunities with Senior Stakeholders in the business,Succession Planning and Annual performance reviews has rater errors

Events and time management were two key areas of growth for me throughout the Inductions.

398,Overall good company but hires and fires too frequently,Engineer,"Salt Lake City, Utah","May 8, 2015","The company provides a great work life balance. There are occasional projects which require overtime or odd shifts but these are rare unless you take a role directly within operations. Like with any engineering job in the mining industry there is no single job you would do. You would be doing anything from day to day data analysis, project work, testing, modeling, or fieldwork. Since there is such good compensation and benefits you work with a really great bunch of people. The work is pretty exciting you will generally have an interesting project or two to work on.My gripe with the company is that mining is a very volatile industry with great highs and horrific lows. Great management fights pressure to go crazy with hiring and capital during the highs and to cut too much capital and people during the lows. In this regard I think Rio Tinto has absolutely horrible senior management. The last two CEOs have given in to the pressure to expand/reduce like they are puppets. Keep in mind the next couple years will be bad years so there will be little chance for advancement. There will be much better chances as metal prices increase. Another potential downside is you will generally be expected to relocate throughout your career.The bottom line is it is a good company to work for but you will need to be fully prepared to suddenly lose your job. You may want to rent instead of buy any property. And keep 6+ months of salary in the bank.","Great coworkers, great compensation",Very low job security
